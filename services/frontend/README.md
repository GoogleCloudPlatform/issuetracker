# Frontend Service

Handles the material design based UI for the project

## Setting up the Development Environment

The frontend uses Angular4 with Angular CLI. You can install Angular CLI by running

    npm install -g @angular/cli

This will let you use the `ng` command as
mentioned below. Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running
`node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors,
but newer versions are fine.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
